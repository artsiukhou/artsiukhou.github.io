How often do you catch yourself on a thought: `"Ok, I should have a blog!"`?
Well, it happens to me all the times. And you know what? I'm tired of it, let's finally try.
I don't know what exactly will I put here, but it would be related to what I do.

What do I do? Well, mostly backend and infra stuff, both SWE and SRE.
So, very plausible, posts here will be about:
- C++, Python, maybe Golang or some other languages
- tips and tricks which are useful for most of the developers: environment setup, tooling, code readability etc
- random thoughts about being a developer and a career growth
